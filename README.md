# Syntax_Analysis


The goal of this analysis is to observe the similarities betweeen languages, and mostly the differences. 

In linguistics, syntax (/ˈsɪntæks/) is the set of rules, principles, and processes that govern the structure of sentences (sentence structure) in a given language, usually including **word order**. The term syntax is also used to refer to the study of such principles and processes. The goal of many syntacticians is to discover the syntactic rules common to all languages. (Wikipedia Souce)
